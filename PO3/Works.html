            <h3>Design Brief</h3>
            <p>DIY travel is an app that makes travel plans for tourists. It can recommend tourist destinations and
                provide tourist strategies according to tourists' wishes. </p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                According to the research that the most stressful part of traveling to the destination was coping
                with weather conditions, traffic jams, and route finding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The participants reported that the most stressful part of their trip was actually the trip planning
                stage, followed by traveling to the destination, and finally the actual stay at the destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people plan trips and take vacations to get away from the stress of home and work; however, very
                few people take travel stress into consideration. While traveling can indeed be an escape or break from
                the day-to-day routine, planning and taking a trip can also be quite stressful.
            </p>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>
                Based on the above research, I create a journey map to explore how will the traverler experience with
                the help of the mobile app to finish their trip.
