            <h3>Design Brief</h3>
            <p>
                Happy Growth is an app that helps cultivate children's interests and hobbies, and it improve the
                relationship between parents and children.
            </p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            Generally, I know most parents attach importance to their children's education. However, More and more
            parents
            do not teach their children in the right way, which leads to cracks in the relationship between children and
            their parents.
            <h3>Interview</h3>
            <p>Firstly, I interviewed 3 families, both of them have plans to educate their children</p>
            <p>Questions:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Both the interviews start with the questions above and also include free talk between me and the
                interviewees. Base on the interviews and some further exploration, I summarize some key points about
                education problem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide great education environment for their children.</li>
                <li>To help their children to develop good habits.</li>
                <li>To find activities that will enhance their childrenâ€™s social skill.</li>
                <li>Hoping children grow up healthily.</li>
                <li>The child has a bright future.</li>
                <li>Hoping children can surpass their parents.</li>
                <li>Do not want and cannot accept the child's future is mediocre.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>Based on the above research and interview, I create a journey map to explore how will the user experience
                with the help of the mobile app to finish their goals.</p>
            <img src="img/Journey.jpg" alt="Education app's journey map">
            <p>Obviously, in this context, the key tags of WHO, HOW, and WHEN are really important for helping user to
                solve the problem. The best scenario will be that the user can capture these tags shortly and help them
                solve the problem before the relationship between parents and childrend break out.</p>
